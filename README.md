# Learn
My friends and I have come up with this idea of helping students learn from the best material available online. We are currently focusing only on Engineering but we would foresee to provide material for all streams of study.
Ideally education has to be given for free but it is no less than a business now. There are so many educators out there providing enormous content on various topics for free. 
"Learn" gives the curated best content available on the internet for a particular field of study. 
Rather than spending all your time inb searching which has good content and which does not, we have verified and uploaded the latest best material for the topics you wish to learn.
We are releasing this in 2 versions; as a website and as an android application. The links for these are mentioned below. Please check them out:)
We have done this small project in the notion of service for the students. We are open to hear all the suggestions and contributions. Also you're free to find bugs. Do contact us regarding the same.
Please register to our application and the website and make the full use of it. Let's LEARN and improve ourselves.
